# Multi-Agent MATE solution

We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility multi-agent system, which performs the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to a format users can understand. For example, if the user cannot hear well and receives an audio, the system converts this audio into a video with subtitles. MATE can be applied to many domains, such as healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users.
